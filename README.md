### Poker Game

<img src='https://github.com/DavidCWHung/poker-game/blob/main/poker-game1280x850.jpg' alt='poker-game' height='300' width='1500'>

I made this project and took this challenge for learning and practicing something new (e.g., LINQ) other than the things taught in my programming classes (and also expressing my passion for poker games).  

This is a simplified poker game, a Console Application written in C# language.  This project is built based on the C# Poker Game YouTube Challenge (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au31WqDtXYI&t=72s&ab_channel=CodingHomework) with certain programming logic (e.g., the tiebreaker rule when both player and computer have the same types of hand) and coding amended and refined. 

The code of this application will be maintained and further optimized with more game features.  Please feel free to let me know if you have any thoughts on improving this application or anything!:smile:



Skills: .Net Framework, C#
